The hardest part of problem solving is taking the question and breaking it down into smaller parts so that you know how to properly answer the problem. If you do not break the problems down, coming up with a strategy to solve the problem becomes difficult. Also remember that the first strategy may not always be the correct way to solve the problem, so keep thinking and check and see if the problem could be simplified if you are having problems coming up with a strategy.
